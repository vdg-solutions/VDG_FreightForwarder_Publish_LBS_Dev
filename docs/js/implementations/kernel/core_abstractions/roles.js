// roles.js — the ONE place JS spells a role name.
//
// The names belong to Rust (`freight/core_abstractions/role.rs::Role`), which serializes exactly
// these strings into every grant file, session and `/api/users` reply. JS keeps a copy because the
// auth gate decides what to render BEFORE the wasm module is loaded and cannot ask the enum then.
//
// A copy is only safe while something checks it: `role.rs::the_js_vocabulary_lists_exactly_these_roles`
// reads THIS file and fails the build if the two lists differ, and lint-js's `no-raw-role-literal`
// fails any other .js that spells a role name itself. Import from here — never re-declare.
