// phase-timeline.js — E-37 (F-37-04). The horizontal phases of a shipment, and what the one it is
// sitting in is still waiting on.
//
// The phase list, the order, the requirements and who owns each of them all come from Rust
// (`shipment_phases` -> operators/fsm/shipment_fsm/checks.rs), which is the SAME table the
// transition guards fold over. A JS copy would be a second statement of the transition rules, and
// its failure mode is a screen saying a job is ready while the FSM refuses to advance it.
//
// This component renders EDIT FOCUS, not state. Clicking a phase moves what the form is showing;
// it does not move the shipment. `state` only ever changes through apply_fsm_event, which is
// guarded and audited — see backlog/wiki/shipment-collaboration-model.md §3.
