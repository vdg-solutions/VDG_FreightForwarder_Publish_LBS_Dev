// validate-shipment-form.js — the shipment form's save/publish gate, split out of sales-new-form.js at the
// 350-line cap. Pure: a state object in, an array of message strings out. No DOM, no repo, so
// the publish rules can be read (and tested) without standing the form up.
//
// F-41-01/F-29-01 AC-05/F-29-02 AC-04/F-41-07/F-29-04 VR-02: every rule that used to live here
// moved to Rust (rulesets::shipment_publish_gate) — this is now a thin call over the wasm gate
// that renders the i18n keys it returns. No business rule is duplicated in JS.

import { t } from '../../../../kernel/core_abstractions/i18n/index.js';

const wasm = () => globalThis.window?.__vdg_wasm || globalThis.__vdg_wasm;

// → string[] (empty = valid); negative margin is NOT a blocker (AC-03)
//
// F-41-01: two of the gate's rules are PUBLISH gates, not save gates. CS opens the job at the
// booking window, before any B/L number or charge line exists — blocking that save blocked the
// whole CS-first flow the process is built on. Publish is the handover to Accounting, which is
// where a job without a bill number or a single line stops being a working file and starts being
// a mistake. Default publish:true keeps every existing caller/test on the strict path.
